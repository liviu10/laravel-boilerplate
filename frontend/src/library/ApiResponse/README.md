# API Response library

This library defines functions for handling API response and extracting data from them. It includes functions for transforming responses, extracting columns, filters, models, and results from a structured response object. If the response is valid, it returns the structured data; otherwise, it handles notifications. The module also defines various interfaces for data structures used in the responses.
